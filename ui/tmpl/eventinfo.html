    <p>The events page lists the events that have been created by club members.  Events have 
    features, such as weather or not they require money, or if they are invite only.  Any user can 
    create an event and add or remove members.  Members of an event will recieve event messages, 
    and can also send messages to the other event members.  Below is a list of event attributes 
    and how the function on the site.<p>

        <dt>Name</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>This is the event name which will show up messages setnt to members.  The event name 
            can only use letters, numbers, and spaces - so be sure to leave out any special 
            characters when creating an event.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Date</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>The event date and time can be set with this field.  Some events will not have set 
            dates, or may be TBD, so this can be left blank.  Events without dates will not be 
            automatically deleted.  However, events that are more than two weeks old will be 
            removed from the list.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Description</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>A short description of the event.  This field does not have the same character 
            limitations as the name, so you can be more creative :)</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Owner</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>The owner of an event defaults to whomever is creating the event.  However, this 
            can be changed to anyone in the player list.  Owners can add/remove members, mark 
            members as paid, and update information like the date, etc.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Paid Event</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>If an event requires money this box should be checked.  It will allow the event

            If an event is created as <code>Invite Only</code> it will not be visable to 
            non-members.  In this case only the event owner, Administrators, or users with the 
            <code>Calendar</code> role can add members.  Events can start as invite only, and be 
            later changed to public.</p>
