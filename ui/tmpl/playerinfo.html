            <p>This is the user's first name and last initial.  In case of any data breaches, we want 
            to refrain from using last names when possible.</p>

        <dt>Communications</dt>
        <dd>
            All users should have the <code>Communications</code> role.  This role allows a user 
            to send messages either through the global messaging page or specific event pages.
